# ðŸ‘¶ Hello world!

After successfully installing Snowball, you can create a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started. Follow these steps:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="New project" %}
Execute the following command and Snowball will create a new folder with the name and its contents for a basic hello world.

```sh
snowball new [name]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Initialize project in current folder" %}
If you already have a folder for the project, just run the following command to prepare that folder for a snowball project.

```sh
snowball init [name]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% content-ref url="../snowball-cli-usage/cli-usage-and-parameters.md" %}
[cli-usage-and-parameters.md](../snowball-cli-usage/cli-usage-and-parameters.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Executing your programs

Nice! You have successfully created a snowball project with a hello world inside it. Now, it's time to execute it by running the following command:

```sh
snowball run
```

You don't need to provide any arguments, snowball will take care of it! ðŸ˜½
