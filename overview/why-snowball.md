# üêà Why Snowball

Snowball is a versatile programming language that offers several compelling reasons to choose it for your projects. Here are some key reasons why Snowball might be the right choice for you:

1. Simplicity and Readability: Snowball aims to be a simple and readable language. Its syntax is designed to be clean and expressive, making it easier to write and understand code. Snowball's approachable nature can reduce the learning curve for developers and enhance code collaboration within teams.
2. Strong Type System: Snowball features a strong and static type system. It helps catch type-related errors at compile-time, preventing many common bugs and providing increased code reliability. The type system promotes code safety, allowing for efficient and robust program development.
3. Memory Safety: Snowball prioritizes memory safety by abstracting away low-level memory management. It removes the burden of manual memory allocation and deallocation, mitigating memory-related errors such as leaks and dangling pointers. This feature contributes to the overall security and stability of Snowball programs.
4. Interoperability: Snowball facilitates interoperability with other programming languages. It supports calling external functions written in C or other languages via the `[[llvm_function]]` attribute and offers mechanisms to interface with existing codebases seamlessly. This capability enables Snowball to be integrated into diverse software ecosystems.
5. Flexibility with LLVM: Snowball leverages the LLVM compiler infrastructure, which provides a robust foundation for optimization and code generation. LLVM enables Snowball to achieve high-performance execution, portability, and compatibility across multiple platforms.
6. Growing Ecosystem: While Snowball is a relatively young language, its ecosystem is expanding. As more developers adopt and contribute to Snowball, the availability of libraries, tools, and community support will continue to grow. This growth fosters innovation and fosters the development of robust applications in Snowball.

Ultimately, the choice of programming language depends on the specific needs of your project and your personal preferences. Snowball's simplicity, strong type system, memory safety, and interoperability make it a compelling option for developers seeking an approachable yet powerful language for their software development endeavors.
