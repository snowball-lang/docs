# âœ¨ Language Features

Snowball encompasses a range of language features that enhance productivity, code organization, and program readability. These features contribute to a pleasant development experience and enable efficient software development. Here are some notable language features of Snowball:

1. Modules: Snowball supports modular programming through its module system. You can organize your code into separate modules, allowing for better code organization and encapsulation. Modules provide a way to group related code together and promote code reuse and maintainability.
2. Structured Programming: Snowball follows a structured programming paradigm, promoting code clarity and maintainability. It supports functions, procedures, and control structures such as loops and conditionals, enabling developers to write clean and structured code.
3. Generics: Snowball supports type generics, allowing you to write reusable code that can adapt to different types. With generics, you can create components and functions that work with a wide range of data types, promoting code reuse and flexibility.
4. Attributes: Snowball provides attributes, allowing you to attach additional metadata or instructions to code elements such as functions or structures. Attributes enable customization and provide a way to communicate specific requirements or behavior to the compiler or runtime.
5. Error Handling: Snowball includes mechanisms for error handling. It provides options to handle errors through mechanisms like exceptions or result types, allowing for robust error management and graceful recovery.
6. Pattern Matching: Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Snowball that enables concise and expressive data manipulation. It allows you to match data structures against patterns and perform specific actions based on the matched pattern. Pattern matching simplifies code and enhances readability, especially when dealing with complex data structures.
7. Concurrency and Parallelism: Snowball supports concurrency and parallelism through constructs like threads or tasks. These features enable the efficient execution of concurrent or parallel tasks, harnessing the full potential of modern multi-core systems.
8. Operator Overloading: Snowball allows for operator overloading, enabling you to define custom behaviors for operators when working with user-defined types. This feature enhances the expressiveness of code and provides a more intuitive interface for custom types.

These language features make Snowball a powerful and expressive programming language, empowering developers to write clean, readable, and efficient code. By leveraging these features, developers can enhance their productivity and build robust applications.
