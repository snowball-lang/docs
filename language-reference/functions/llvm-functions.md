# ðŸ’¢ LLVM Functions

In Snowball, you can embed LLVM code within a function using the `[[llvm_function]]` attribute. This allows you to directly write LLVM code for low-level optimizations or specific functionality. Here's an example of how to define an LLVM function in Snowball:

```swift
@llvm_function
func example() {
    // LLVM code here
}
```

When defining an LLVM function, you have the flexibility to write low-level code directly using the LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Here's a simple example of LLVM code within an LLVM function:

```swift
@llvm_function
func example() {
    %add = add i32 2, 3   ; Add 2 and 3, result stored in %add
    ret i32 %add          ; Return the value stored in %add
}
```

In this example, the LLVM code performs an addition operation between the integers 2 and 3. The result is stored in the `%add` register, and then it is returned using the `ret` instruction.

By using the `llvm_function` attribute, you can leverage the power and flexibility of LLVM to optimize specific sections of your Snowball code or implement functionality that requires fine-grained control over the machine-level operations.

Please note that writing LLVM code requires a good understanding of the LLVM IR and low-level optimizations. Be cautious while using LLVM functions and ensure that they are used appropriately and sparingly within your Snowball programs.

Snowball should provide you with the necessary tools to create virtually anything but this feature exists in case something requires more low-level unsafeness.
