# üê£ Basic syntax

#### Argument list

In Snowball, you can define function arguments using the following syntax:

```rust
fn function_name(argument_name: data_type) {
    // Function body
}
```

For example, let's consider a function called `hello` that takes a single argument `x` of type `i32` (32-bit integer). The syntax for defining such a function with an argument in Snowball would be:

```rust
fn hello(x: i32) {
    // Function body
}
```

In this example, the function `hello` has an argument `x` of type `i32`. You can replace `i32` with other supported data types based on your specific requirements, such as `u32` for unsigned 32-bit integers, `f64` for 64-bit floating-point numbers, or `String` for strings.

Within the function body, you can access and use the argument `x` as needed to perform operations or calculations. Remember to provide the appropriate data type when invoking the `hello` function and passing values for the argument.

Using the syntax mentioned above, you can define functions with different arguments in Snowball, allowing for flexible and modular code development.

#### Return types

In Snowball, you can specify the return type of a function using the following syntax:

```rust
fn function_name() return_type {
    // Function body
    // Return statement
}
```

Using the syntax mentioned above, you can define functions with different return types in Snowball, allowing you to perform computations and provide results based on your program's requirements.

**Voided functions**

To declare a function as `void`, there's no need to declare `void` type, just can just not put anything:

```rust
fn noReturns() {
    // tada!
}
```
{% endhint %}
