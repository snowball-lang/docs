# ðŸ”¢ Primitive types

Snowball provides a set of primitive types that serve as the building blocks for representing basic data in your programs. These types are essential for storing and manipulating fundamental values. Here are the primitive types in Snowball:

### Integer types

* `i8`: 8-bit signed integer type.
* `i16`: 16-bit signed integer type.
* `i32`: 32-bit signed integer type.
* `i64`: 64-bit signed integer type.
* `u8`: 8-bit unsigned integer type.
* `u16`: 16-bit unsigned integer type.
* `u32`: 32-bit unsigned integer type.
* `u64`: 64-bit unsigned integer type.

### Floating-Point Types

* `f32`: 32-bit floating-point type (single-precision).
* `f64`: 64-bit floating-point type (double-precision).

### Boolean Type

* `bool`: A Boolean type representing either `true` or `false`.

### Character Type:

* `char`: A character type representing a single Unicode character.

### C Object type

* `cobj`: A representation of a pointer with an unknown-sized type as pointer base.

These primitive types provide the foundation for representing and manipulating various kinds of data in Snowball programs. They have different sizes and properties, allowing you to choose the appropriate type based on your specific requirements.

By understanding and utilizing these primitive types effectively, you can perform arithmetic operations, logical evaluations, and handle textual data within your Snowball programs.
