# üì¶ The \`cobj\` primitive type

In Snowball, the `cobj` primitive type serves as an interface similar to the `void*` type in the C programming language. It allows you to work with [opaque objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque\_data\_type) or data whose specific type is unknown or irrelevant at compile-time. The `cobj` type provides a level of abstraction, enabling you to pass around and manipulate these objects without directly accessing their internal structure. Here's how the `cobj` type is used in Snowball:

1. Declaration and Assignment:
   * Syntax: `let x: cobj`
   * Description: Declares a variable `x` of type `cobj` and assigns it a value representing an opaque object or data.
2. Manipulation:
   * Since the `cobj` type represents an opaque object, you cannot directly access or modify its internal structure. However, you can pass it to functions or APIs that operate on opaque objects, treating it as a generic or untyped container.
3. Type Safety Considerations:
   * It's important to exercise caution when working with `cobj` types since Snowball's type checking cannot verify the correctness of operations performed on these objects. It is your responsibility to ensure that the appropriate operations and type conversions are applied when working with `cobj` values.&#x20;
   * [‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning/) **ALL TYPES CAN CAST TO `cobj` AND THE OTHER WAY AROUND**

The `cobj` type in Snowball allows you to interact with external code or libraries that use opaque objects or untyped data. It provides a level of flexibility and interoperability, but it also requires careful handling and consideration of type safety to avoid potential errors.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the usage and handling of `cobj` values may vary depending on the specific external code or library you are working with. It's important to consult the documentation or guidelines provided by the relevant external source for proper usage and best practices.
