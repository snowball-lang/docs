# ðŸŽ­ Types

Snowball is a statically-typed programming language, meaning that all variables and expressions have a specific type that is determined at compile-time. Snowball provides various built-in types to represent different kinds of data.

{% content-ref url="types/primitive-types.md" %}
[primitive-types.md](types/primitive-types.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

In Snowball, reference types provide a safe way to refer to and manipulate data without exposing low-level memory management

{% content-ref url="types/reference-types.md" %}
[reference-types.md](types/reference-types.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
